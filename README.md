- Hardhat for smart contract development
- MetaMask or another Ethereum wallet

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Compile the smart contract:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

4. Copy the contract artifacts to the public folder:

```bash
node scripts/copyArtifacts.js
```

5. Start a local Ethereum node:

```bash
npx hardhat node
```

6. In a new terminal, deploy the contract to the local node:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

7. Copy the deployed contract address

8. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

9. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

10. Connect your MetaMask wallet to the local network (Localhost:8545)

## Smart Contracts

The platform uses a main `EventRegistration.sol` contract which:

- Creates and manages events
- Handles ticket sales
- Issues NFT tickets to attendees
- Verifies ticket ownership

## Development Workflow

1. Connect your wallet as either a user or organization
2. Upon Connecting wallet user mints a NFT linked to thr profile.
3. Attendee can store skills as assets and they will mint badges and POAPs as Soulbound NFTs.
4. Organizations can create events with customizable parameters
5. Users can view events and register to attend
6. Tickets are stored as NFTs on the blockchain
7. Event creators can verify attendance using the contract's verification system
